# Security Policy

## Purpose

This project is an educational proof-of-concept designed to demonstrate prompt injection vulnerabilities in AI-powered browsers in a safe, responsible manner.

## Responsible Use Guidelines

### ✅ Acceptable Use

- Testing on your own AI browsers
- Educational demonstrations
- Security research
- Developing defensive measures
- Academic study of AI security

### ❌ Prohibited Use

- Testing on systems you don't own without explicit permission
- Malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Creating actual exploits that exfiltrate data
- Using techniques learned here for harmful purposes
- Unauthorized access to others' accounts or data

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

### If You Find Issues with This PoC

If you discover security issues with this proof-of-concept itself (e.g., unintentionally harmful behavior), please:

1. **Do not** publicly disclose the issue immediately
2. Contact the project maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed information about the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for assessment and fixes

### If You Discover Real Vulnerabilities in AI Browsers

If you use this PoC and discover actual vulnerabilities in AI-powered browsers:

1. **Follow Responsible Disclosure:**
   - Report findings directly to the affected vendor's security team
   - Provide clear reproduction steps
   - Give the vendor reasonable time to patch (typically 90 days)
   - Do not publicly disclose until patched or time expires

2. **Contact Information for Major AI Browser Vendors:**
   - OpenAI (ChatGPT Atlas): security@openai.com
   - Perplexity (Comet): Check their website for security contact
   - Brave: security@brave.com
   - Report through vendor bug bounty programs when available

3. **What to Include in Reports:**
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigations (if any)
   - Your contact information for follow-up

## Bug Bounty Programs

Many AI companies offer bug bounty programs that reward security researchers for responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities. Check:

- HackerOne
- Bugcrowd
- Individual company security pages

## Disclosure Timeline

If you discover and report a vulnerability:

1. **Day 0**: Report to vendor privately
2. **Day 1-7**: Vendor acknowledges receipt
3. **Day 7-90**: Vendor investigates and develops fix
4. **Day 90**: If no fix, consider limited public disclosure
5. **Post-Fix**: Full public disclosure with vendor coordination

## Legal Considerations

- Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal in most jurisdictions
- Testing must be limited to systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Violating terms of service may have legal consequences
- Always consult legal counsel before security testing in professional contexts

## Educational Institutions

If using this project for educational purposes:

- Ensure students understand ethical boundaries
- Use only in controlled, isolated environments
- Do not test on production systems
- Incorporate discussions of responsible disclosure
- Include legal and ethical considerations in curriculum

## Ethical Framework

This project adheres to the following ethical principles:

1. **Do No Harm**: Demonstrations should be benign and non-destructive
2. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate purpose and limitations
3. **Responsibility**: Users are accountable for their actions
4. **Collaboration**: Work with vendors, not against them
5. **Education**: Share knowledge to improve overall security

## Updates to This Policy

This security policy may be updated as:
- New vulnerabilities are discovered
- Vendor disclosure policies change
- Legal frameworks evolve
- Community feedback is received

## Questions?

For questions about responsible use or ethical considerations, please open an issue in the project repository or contact the maintainers.

**Remember:** The goal is to make AI browsers more secure, not to exploit them. Responsible disclosure helps everyone.
